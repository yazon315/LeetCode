| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

Explanation: 
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.


**Решение:**

```SQL
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(customer_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits AS v
    LEFT JOIN Transactions AS t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id;

In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

Find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:

| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |

| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |

Output: 

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).


**Решение:**

```SQL
SELECT  id
FROM (SELECT  id,
              recordDate,
              temperature,
              LAG(recordDate, 1) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS date_prev,
              LAG(temperature, 1 ) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS temp_prev
      FROM Weather) AS temp
WHERE (temperature - temp_prev) > 0
  AND DATEDIFF(recordDate, date_prev) = 1;
```


### [Задача 10](#решение-задач-sql-50-на-leetcode)

**1661. Average Time of Process per Machine**

Table: Activity

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |

The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:

| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |

| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |

| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

Explanation: 
There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456


**Решение:**

```SQL
WITH
a1 AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Activity
    WHERE activity_type = 'start'),
a2 AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Activity
    WHERE activity_type = 'end')

SELECT  a1.machine_id,
        ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM a1
    JOIN a2 ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id
            AND a1.process_id = a2.process_id

| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |

Output: 

| user_id | confirmation_rate |
|---------|-------------------|
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |

Explanation: 
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.


**Решение:**

```SQL
WITH

  SELECT  user_id,
          COUNT(user_id) AS count_con
  FROM Confirmations
  WHERE action = 'confirmed'
  GROUP BY user_id),

| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |

Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

**Решение:**

```SQL

| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |

Output: 

| contest_id | percentage |
|------------|------------|
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |

| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |

Explanation: 
All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%

**Решение:**

```SQL
SELECT  contest_id,
        ROUND(100 * COUNT(user_id) / (SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage
FROM Register
GROUP BY contest_id
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id;
```


### [Задача 19](#решение-задач-sql-50-на-leetcode)

**1211. Queries Quality and Percentage**

Table: Queries

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |

This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Queries table:

| query_name | result            | position | rating |
|------------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |

Output: 

| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
|------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |

Explanation: 
Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

**Решение:**

```SQL
WITH
p AS(
SELECT  query_name,
        COUNT(rating) AS poor
FROM Queries
WHERE rating < 3
GROUP BY query_name)

SELECT  q.query_name,
        ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality,
        CASE
          WHEN poor IS NULL THEN 0
          ELSE ROUND(100 * poor / COUNT(rating), 2)
        END AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries AS q
  LEFT JOIN p ON q.query_name=p.query_name
GROUP BY query_name;
```

### [Задача 21](#решение-задач-sql-50-на-leetcode)

**1174. Immediate Food Delivery II**

Table: Delivery

| Column Name                 | Type    |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Delivery table:

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |

Output: 

| immediate_percentage |
|----------------------|
| 50.00                |

Explanation: 
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.

**Решение:**

```SQL
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM Delivery), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM (SELECT  customer_id,
              order_date,
              customer_pref_delivery_date,
              MIN(order_date) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id) AS first_date
      FROM Delivery) AS temp
WHERE order_date=first_date
  AND customer_pref_delivery_date=order_date

**550. Game Play Analysis IV**

Table: Activity

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

Output: 

| fraction  |
|-----------|
| 0.33      |

Explanation: 
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33

**Решение:**

```SQL
-- вариант 1
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM (SELECT  player_id,
              event_date,
              MIN(event_date) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id) AS first_login
      FROM Activity) AS temp
WHERE DATEDIFF(event_date, first_login) = 1;


--вариант 2
SELECT ROUND(SUM(two_consecutive_days) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM (SELECT  player_id,
              event_date,
              DATEDIFF(event_date, MIN(event_date) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id)) = 1 AS two_consecutive_days

**619. Biggest Single Number**

Table: MyNumbers

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| num         | int  |

This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:

| num |
|-----|
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |

Output: 

| num |
|-----|
| 6   |

Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
Example 2:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:

| num |
|-----|
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |

Output: 

| num  |
|------|
| null |

Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.

**Решение:**

```SQL
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (SELECT  num
      FROM MyNumbers
      GROUP BY num
      HAVING COUNT(num) = 1) AS temp;
```

**1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee**

Table: Employees

| Column Name | Type     |
|-------------|----------|
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |

employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null). 

For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write an SQL query to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:

| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |

Output: 

| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
|-------------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |

Explanation: Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.

**Решение:**

```SQL
WITH
t1 AS(
SELECT  reports_to AS employee_id,
        COUNT(employee_id) AS reports_count,
        ROUND(AVG(age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees
WHERE reports_to IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY reports_to
)

SELECT  t1.employee_id,

| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |

(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.

Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input:

| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |

Output: 

| employee_id |
|-------------|
| 11          |

Explanation: 
The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.

**Решение:**

```SQL
WITH
t AS (
     SELECT employee_id
          , manager_id
     FROM Employees
     WHERE salary < 30000
     AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT t.employee_id
FROM t
     LEFT JOIN Employees AS e ON t.manager_id=e.employee_id
WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY t.employee_id;
```

**626. Exchange Seats**

Table: Seat

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |

id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |

**1321. Restaurant Growth**

Table: Customer

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |

In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:

| customer_id | name         | visited_on   | amount      |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|

| 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |

Explanation: 
1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86
2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120
3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120
4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86

**Решение:**

```SQL
-- вариант 1
SELECT c.visited_on
     , (SELECT SUM(t.amount)
        FROM Customer AS t
        WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on) AS amount

### [Задача 41](#решение-задач-sql-50-на-leetcode)

**602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends**

Table: RequestAccepted

| Column Name    | Type    |
|----------------|---------|
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |

(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:

| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |

Output: 

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |

Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.

**Решение:**

```SQL
SELECT id
     , SUM(num) AS num
FROM (
     SELECT requester_id AS id
          , COUNT(accepter_id) AS num
     FROM RequestAccepted
     GROUP BY requester_id
     UNION ALL
     SELECT accepter_id AS id
          , COUNT(requester_id) AS num
     FROM RequestAccepted
     GROUP BY accepter_id
     ) AS temp
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Follow up: In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?

**Решение:**

```SQL
WITH
t AS(
     SELECT id
          , SUM(num) AS num
     FROM (
          SELECT requester_id AS id

          FROM RequestAccepted
          GROUP BY accepter_id
          ) AS temp
     GROUP BY id

### [Задача 42](#решение-задач-sql-50-на-leetcode)

**585. Investments in 2016**

Table: Insurance

| Column Name | Type  |
|-------------|-------|
| pid         | int   |
| tiv_2015    | float |
| tiv_2016    | float |
| lat         | float |
| lon         | float |

pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:
pid is the policyholder's policy ID.
tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.
lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.
lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.

Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Insurance table:

| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |

Output: 

| tiv_2016 |
|----------|
| 45.00    |

Explanation: 
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.
So, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.

**Решение:**

```SQL
WITH
t1 AS (
          SELECT pid
               , tiv_2016
          FROM Insurance
          GROUP BY lat, lon
          HAVING count(pid) = 1
      ),

t2 AS (
          SELECT pid
               , tiv_2016
          FROM (
               SELECT pid
                    , tiv_2016
                    , COUNT(pid) OVER(PARTITION BY tiv_2015) AS count
               FROM Insurance
               ) AS temp
          WHERE count > 1
      )

SELECT ROUND(SUM(t1.tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM t1
     INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.pid=t2.pid;

'conditions' contains 0 or more code separated by spaces. 
This table contains information of the patients in the hospital.

Write a solution to find the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions of the patients who have Type I Diabetes. Type I Diabetes always starts with DIAB1 prefix.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Patients table:

| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |
| 2          | Alice        |              |
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
| 5          | Alain        | DIAB201      |

Output: 

| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 | 

Explanation: Bob and George both have a condition that starts with DIAB1.

**Решение:**

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Patients
WHERE INSTR(conditions, ' DIAB1') > 0
   OR LEFT(conditions, 5) = 'DIAB1';
```


### [Задача 46](#решение-задач-sql-50-на-leetcode)

**196. Delete Duplicate Emails**

Table: Person

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

Output: 

| id | email            |
|----|------------------|
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |

Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

**Решение:**

```SQL
DELETE
FROM Person
WHERE id IN(SELECT id
            FROM (SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY id) AS c FROM Person) AS t
            WHERE c > 1);
```


### [Задача 47](#решение-задач-sql-50-на-leetcode)

**176. Second Highest Salary**

Table: Employee

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |

Output: 

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| 200                 |

Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:

| id | salary |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |

Output: 

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
| null                |

**Решение:**

```SQL
-- вариант 1
SELECT (
        SELECT DISTINCT salary AS SecondHighestSalary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY SecondHighestSalary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
        ) AS SecondHighestSalary;

-- вариант 2
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary 
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
```

**1484. Group Sold Products By The Date**

Table Activities:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |

There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.

Write a solution to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Activities table:

| sell_date  | product    |
|------------|------------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |

Output: 

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |

Explanation: 
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

**Решение:**

```SQL
SELECT sell_date
     , COUNT(product) AS num_sold
     , GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product) AS products
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT * FROM Activities) AS u
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date;
```
